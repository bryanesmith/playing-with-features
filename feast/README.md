# Feast projects

## driven_hyena

Consuming offline, online features from the sample Feast offline store, `driver_stats.parquet`.

## living_pegasus

Converting CSV from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/download) to Panda DataFrame, and using that as offline store.

Note features are cumulative. (Most likely, we'd want these to be non-cumulative, but I don't want to do work.)
